Trackable Client .NET 4.5 Entities ReadMe

NOTE: Because these client entities are targeted to .NET 4.5 or greater,
you can use either the Entity Framewor Power Tools or the EF 6.x Tools 
for Visual Studio to generate entities.

This project template references the TrackableEntities.Client NuGet
package, which contains a ChangeTrackingCollection<T> that sets the
TrackingState and ModifiedProperties properties on each entity.

To get started, right-click on the project, select Entity Framework,
Reverse Engineer Code First.  The tool will generate classes for
data context and mapping classes, as well as trackable client entities.

IMPORTANT: After running the tool, be sure to delete the Mapping folder
and classes, and also the DbContext-derived class that was generated.
These must be removed because the project will not reference the
Entity Framework NuGet package.  Clients should avoid referencing
any particular data access library and instead invoke a service
for retrieving and saving entities to a database.

This project is based on a portable class library and can be referenced
from clients based on .NET 4.5, Silverlight 5 and higher, Windows Phone
8 and higher, or Windows Store Apps.

Web API Relations Sample ReadMe

This sample demonstrates how to update 1-1, M-1 and M-M relations 
using Trackable Entities.

NOTE: You must first install either the Entity Framework Power Tools,
or the EF 6.1 Tools for Visual Studio. These steps use a scaled down version
of the Northwind database, which you can get here: http://bit.ly/northwindslim.

By default LocalDb is used and the NorthwindSlim databased is
created and seeded with a small amount of data when you first
run the WebApi service. Optionally, you can use SQL Express (or
another edition), create NorthwindSlim manually and run the
SQL script in the Data folder to create and populate the tables.

Before starting the client Console app, build the solution, then
right-click on the Web Api project and select View in Browser.
This will start the service using the development web server.

To replicate this sample follow these steps Program.Main of the ConsoleClient project:

Part A: One-to-One Relations

1. Add a new setting to a customer.
   - Adding a new setting requires that you manually mark it as Added

2. Modify a property on the customer's setting.
   - The setting will automatically be marked as Modified

3. Remove the customer's setting.
   - Removing a new setting requires that you manually mark it as Deleted

Part B: Many-to-One Relations

1. Add a new customer to an existing order
   - Manually marking the customer as Added will result in a NEW customer
     being added to the database.
   - To add an existing customer, simply set the Order.CustomerId foreign key property
 
2. Modify a property on the order customer
   - Order.Customer is automatically change-tracked, so updating the CompanyName
     property will mark it as Modified.

Part C: Many-to-Many Relation

1. Employee and Territory have a M-M relationship, so adding or removing entities from
   either side will remove the relationship without deleting the related entity.
   - Add an existing territory to the Employee.Territories property.
   - Modify a property on one of the employee territories
   - Remove one of the employee territories

2. After updating the employee, merge changes back into the employee change tracker
   - This will add inserted territories, merge in modified properties on updated
     territories, and purge cached deleted territories

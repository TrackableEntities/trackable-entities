Web API Patterns Sample ReadMe

NOTE: You must first install the Entity Framework Power Tools.
Support for EF 6.1 Tools for Visual Studio will be added in a future version.

These steps use a scaled down version of the Northwind database, 
which you can get here: http://bit.ly/northwindslim.

This solutions demonstrates using Trackable Entities with the Repository
and Unit of Work patterns to abstract away the underlying data access
technology.  This allows for greater flexibility and the ability to switch
from one data provider to another without re-writing application code.

1. Add Repository and Unit of Work Interfaces to the Service.Persistence project.
   - Right-click the Repositories folder, Add New Item, Trackable category,
     select "Entity Repository Interface"
	 > Enter an interface name, for example: IProductRepository
	 > Select a trackable entity from the drop down in wizard, 
	   for example: Product
	 > Enter the entity set name for the entity, for example: Products
     > Add other entity repository interfaces as needed
   - Right-click the UnitsOfWork folder, Add New Item, Trackable category,
     select "Example Unit of Work Interface"
	 > Enter a name, for example: INorthwindUnitOfWork
	 > Add read-only properties for each entity repository interface,
	   for example: IProductRepository ProductRepository { get; }
	 > Add using directives for the entity repository interface

2. Add a Database Context Interface to the Service.EF project
   - Right-click the Contexts folder, Add New Item, Trackable category,
     select "Database Context Interface"
	 > Enter an interface name, for example: INorthwindContext
	 > Add IDbSet<Entity> properties for each entity set on the DbContext class
	 > For example: IDbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
   - Alter DbContext class to implement this interface
     > Open the DbContext-derived class added by the EF Power Tools,
	   for example: NorthwindDataContext
	 > Implement the Database Context Interface you added,
	   for example: public partial class NorthwindSlimContext : DbContext, INorthwindContext
	 > Change each DbSet property to IDbSet

3. Add Entity Repository Classes to the Service.EF project
   - Right-click the Repositories folder, Add New Item, Trackable category,
     select "Entity Repository Class"
	 > Enter an class name, for example: ProductRepository
     > Select a trackable entity from the drop down list in the wizard
	   and enter an entity set name, for example: Product, Products
	 > Change IDatabaseContext to match the name of the Database Context Interface
	   you added earlier, for example: INorthwindContext
	 > Add Include statements as needed to the Get methods for including
	   related entities
	 > If the entity has child entities, remove them in the Delete method

4. Add a Unit of Work class to the Service.EF project
   - Right-click the UnitsOfWork folder, Add New Item, Trackable category,
     select "Example Unit of Work Class"
	 > Enter a class name that matches the Unit of Work Interface added earlier
	   to the Service.Persistence project, for example: NorthwindUnitOfWork
   - Add read-only fields for each entity repository interface, for example:
     private readonly IProductRepository _productRepository
   - Update the class ctor by renaming IDatabaseContext to match the context
     interface you added earlier, for example: INorthwindContext
	 > Then add repository interface parameters for each field you added,
	   for example: IProductRepository productRepository
	 > Initialize each entity repository field using the ctor parameters,
	   for example: _productRepository = productRepository;
   - Next add read-only property for each entity repository interface, for example:
     public IProductRepository ProductRepository
     {
         get { return _productRepository; }
     }
   - Lastly add a using directive to resolve the Exception classes namespace:
     using WebApiSample.Service.Persistence.Exceptions
	 > Also resolve any another namespaces as needed

5. Add Entity Web API Controllers to the Service.WebApi project
   - Right-click the Controllers folder, Add New Item, Trackable category,
     select "Entity Web API Controller"
	 > Enter a name that matches an entity, for example: ProductController
   - Rename IExampleUnitOfWork to match Unit of Work Interface added to Persistence project
   - Likewise Rename IExampleUnitOfWork parameter of class ctor
